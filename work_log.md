  1. added l2 regularization term to cpgTrain_pytorch.py
  2. Created a separate file deepcpg_DNA_Train_pytorch.py
  
  #### To Do:
  + *run deepcpg DNA module for D7_CTB_S3 and compare loss with deepcpg_DNA_Train_pytorch.py*
  + *modify cpgTrain_pytorch.py to run multipul cell data*
  + *save model on val loss*
  + *write code for learning curves*
  + *write code for KNN for predictions*
  + *write code for label weights*
  + *push code to github*
